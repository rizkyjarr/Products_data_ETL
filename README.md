## Abstract

This exercise was completed by Rizky Fajar Aditya as part of the learning materials at Purwadhika School. The datasets utilized in this project were scraped from an online marketplace and consist of several CSV files that needed to be merged into a single dataframe.

Python and the pandas library were employed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

The outcome of this exercise is a well-structured and transformed dataset, ready for further analysis.

## Task Description

Source of data: [products-dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16GiSVEizqH11OxlPduncwO8eoo6wKufv?hl=ID)


- Every data engineering trainee at Purwadhika is tasked with demonstrating their data transformation and cleansing skills using the provided datasets.
- The dataset, known as the products data, consists of 140 CSV different files.
- The goal is to transform and cleanse the data until it is fully "analytics-ready".

## Data cleaning process

The whole data cleaning process was performed using Pandas Library [data_product.py](https://github.com/rizkyjarr/Products_data_ETL/blob/main/data_product.py)

The documentation of the process is included in the file [data_product_cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/rizkyjarr/Products_data_ETL/blob/main/data_product_cleaning.ipynb)

## Analysis

To be updated

## Summary

The datasets provided by purwadika is transformed through this exercise and is "analytical ready"
